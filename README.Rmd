The goal of purify is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of purify from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrvanderdoes/purify")
```

## General Notes for development

I will add github actions later, but with regular development, if I add it too soon, we will use all of the actions up for the month in a few days.


<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
