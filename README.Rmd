Purify provides a robust framework for resampling data with potential dependency and / or uneven group sizes. The methods of resampling, cross-validation, and forecasting confidence intervals purify the data resulting in improved conclusions under a variety of scenarios. The functions are robust and flexible permitting direct use or seamless integration into the custom analyses. See example uses in Tetui et al. (2022) \<doi:10.1080/21645515.2022.2089500\> and Alexander, K. L., Hall, K., & Chen, Y. M. (2024) \<doi:10.29173/jchla29798\>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of purify from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrvanderdoes/purify")
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
