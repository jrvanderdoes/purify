\usage{
resample(
  data,
  M = 1000,
  resample_blocks = c("separate", "sliding"),
  replace = TRUE,
  blocksize = 1,
  strata = NULL,
  sizes = NULL,
  fn = NULL,
  ignore.columns = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.frame (or vector) to be resampled where the rows are the
observations and the columns are the variables. Note, all variables are
permuted not specified in \code{ignore.columns}.}

\item{M}{Numeric. Number of resample iterations.}

\item{resample_blocks}{String indicating method of selecting resample blocks.
Options are 'separate' and 'sliding'. When \code{blocksize} is 1, there is no
difference. Sliding take sliding groups, thus repeating values, i.e. 1-4,
2-5, 3-6, and so on. Separate does not repeat the values, i.e. 1-4, 5-8,
9-12, and so on. Size of each block is defined using \code{blocksize}.}

\item{replace}{Boolean. Indicates if the data should be permuted (FALSE) or
bootstrapped (TRUE). Note that permutation may be impossible with large
\code{sizes}.}

\item{blocksize}{Numeric for the size of the blocks.}

\item{strata}{String or numeric. This indicate the column to stratify the
data when \code{method} is stratify. This can be the column number or the
column name. When NULL the data is not stratified. When given, strata are
sampled separately.}

\item{sizes}{Option for selecting the resampled size or sizes of each stata.
When used for non-strata, either numeric or NULL and is taken as the number
of observations. When used for strate, can be
numeric (single value or a value for each strata), function (e.g. min or
max), or NULL (original sizes).}

\item{fn}{Function to apply on the resampled data. When NULL, the resampled
data are directly returned.}

\item{ignore.columns}{Name or column numbers to ignore when resampling data.
These are not permuted. Note that if less/more samples are collected than
the original, these are permuted separately.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters for \code{fn}.}
}
\value{
Resampled data sets or function applied to resampled data.
}
\description{
Function to allow various resampling of data, and application to a function
as desired. Choices for simple, stratified, and block (both sliding and
separate) resampling. Bootstrap and permutation resampling can be performed.

\examples{
results <- resample(1:100)
results <- resample(1:100, fn = mean)

n <- 50
data <- data.frame(
  output = NA,
  predictor1 = rnorm(n),
  predictor2 = rnorm(n)
)
data$output <- 2 * data$predictor1 - data$predictor2 + stats::rnorm(nrow(data))
results <- resample(data, ignore.columns = "output")

fn <- function(data) {
  coef(lm(output ~ ., data = data))
}
# Warning, M is below recommendation for example speed
results <- resample(data = data, fn = fn, M = 10, ignore.columns = "output")
