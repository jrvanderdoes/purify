Description: Resampling, including cross-validation, for data under dependence 
  and uneven groups. Methods to purify the conclusions drawn from data under 
  such affects are addressed. Robust and flexible to fit into the workflow of
  various analysis. Discussions on bootstrapping, permutation, and 
  cross-validation can be found in works such as Efron, B., & Tibshirani, R. (1993)
  <doi:10.1201/9780429246593> and Anthony C., & Hinkley, D. V. (1997) 
  <doi:10.2307/1271471>. Sampling methods, with comments on stratification,
  are found in Thompson, S. K. (2012) <doi:10.1002/9781118162934>. Examples which 
  use this package include Tetui et al. (2022) <doi:10.1080/21645515.2022.2089500>.
